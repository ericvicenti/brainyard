## Onboarding

Start off in a nearly empty room

There is a "welcome" building that you can walk into and/or click on

HUD includes only "help"

Walk into "welcome" building, there are lots of things in here

Top left of screen has title of the room. First room is "Home" now is "Welcome".

Click on a "text" thing, a dialog box opens. it is an empty piece of text that you can edit

The dialog has a pin button in the corner (and cmd-p) will add it to your current HUD after the last item in the index.

When click on the new text button in the HUD, it duplicates this text thing at the characters current location.

Right click HUD -> edit, duplicate, remove

edit opens the dialog and allows you to continue modifying the HUD value

same for numbers + switches. now the user can create data and litter it around
